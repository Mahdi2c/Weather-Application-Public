# Weather-Application-Public

This application is designed for cyclists. The main goal of the app was to give the user all the information needed about the weather with a quick glance, as a cyclist would require information quick when cycling.

APIS were used to fetch the weather information - and boilerplate was used (pReact)

Landing page of the weather application:

The bottom of the page shows the forecast for the next two days. Above it, it shows the hourly forecast with an icon to show the user the hourly weather. There is also an emergency alerts prompt that lets the cyclist know about any extreme weathers to watch out for.

Inbuilt map feature that allows you to use the map while cycling:
